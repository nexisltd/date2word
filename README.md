# Date Converter

A versatile JavaScript library for converting Date objects into human-readable, beautifully formatted date strings. Easily integrate it into your projects and applications to display dates in a more user-friendly way.

## Installation

To install the `date2word` library, you can use npm or yarn or pnpm:

```bash
npm install @nexisltd/date2word
# or

## Usage

Here's how you can use the library in your JavaScript or TypeScript code:

```javascript
import dateConverter from 'date2word';

const myDate = new Date();
const formattedDate = dateConverter(myDate,{});

The `dateConverter` function takes a Date object and provides a variety of formatting options. You can capitalize the month and year, choose between displaying the date or the month first, and more.

## Features

- **Customizable**: Tailor the date format to your needs by specifying various options.
- **Human-Readable**: The library converts dates into user-friendly, natural language strings.

## Example

```javascript
import dateConverter from 'date2word';

const myDate = new Date('2023-10-15');
const formattedDate = dateConverter(myDate, {
  isCapitalized: true, // Capitalize the month and year
  isDateFirst: true,   // Display the date before the month
});

console.log(formattedDate); // Outputs "Fifteenth October, Twenty Twenty-Three"
```
